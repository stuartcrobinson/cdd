the point is to be a framework for LLMs to effectively do software developmenet.  formalizing dependencies for components including inthe documentation.  for auto context assembly  but honeslty lately i'm feeling like the covenants are overkill.  the extra step is just a ton of work.  we should just write the tests.  but maybe the design should be to always use dynamic tests?  and externalize the test cases into .json or .md files. thats what we did for sham-parserjs === nesl-js.  seems good, sensible, clear, explicit.  easy to read.    yeah i feel p strongly about that.  each unit test should be a single tiny code file that just pulls in all the test cases from an exteranl test cases file or dir. horrible when input/outputs are embedded in the test code.  "specs" are horrible ... given/ expect / blah blah blah... just list out all expectiations in the structured format that the test will directly read and test  lets call this ... dynamic tests ... formalized dependency management among documentation ... documentation driven development ... test driven developement

i think the work flow needs to include like.... first we write test case data for end-to-end full component tests... but we keep in mind that these test cases are subject to change as we build out the actual functions and any subcomponents and unit tests.  next, we write like kinda psuedocode for the component.  and then we think about what all the pure functions we have and could have, and go ahead and extract them from the pseudocode.  then we take a look at the pseudocde where everything has been factored out that makes sense to factor out.  then we create unit test test cases for each of those individual functions.  and then we write those functions and red/green debug the indiivdual functions.  then once the individual functions are working, we take another look at the whole-compeontent e2e test cases and see if they still make sense given our latest unit test cases, and individual function behaviors.   then we edit the e2e test cases appropriately.  and then we write the main component code that ties all the already-tested functions together. and then we red/green/debug test the main component e2e tests

and through all of this, we make absolutely sure to never edit the tests.  once a test is written, it CANNOT be edited.  during debug, we edit the code only.  so the cod ematches the test.

BUT!!!!! we acknowledge taht SOMETIMES there could be mistakes in the test, so we MIGHT need to edit the tests.  but if we ever need to, we maek crystal clear to the human user that that is what we think we need to do.  and we NEVER update the test without explicit human approval.

and also we make sure that the documentation stays SSOT-accurate for the code as we change and update the code.  often, the documentation will need to change as we learn more about reasonable implementation approaches.  and that's fine.  we just have to make sure that the documeattion gets corrected before the tests and the code, if necessary.
